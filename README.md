# Project Title: Home Automation System with GSM Module

#Abstract

This project was created as a prototype for our ECS project review.
We wanted to create a system to automate basic home appliances like lights and fans in an internet-less environment to help people who live in areas without stable internet access.
We came up with an Arduino UNO based system that uses a GSM module to send SMS messages through 2G network to relay the commands to turn on or off the appliances and give their current status.
The appliances can be controlled through an Android smartphone's SMS app after connecting the arduino system to the appliances.
